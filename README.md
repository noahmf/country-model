# Country model

This is the public version of a data set and model I use to try to understand the world.

The primary output file is under [/6-data-out/data.csv](https://github.com/noahmf/model-country/tree/main/6-data-out).

## Methodology

Methodologies are in flux.  All scripts and data can be downloaded at [github.com/noahmf/model-country](https://github.com/noahmf/model-country/).

In general, series are designed to harmonize estimates from the most authoritative or comprehensive sources for different periods or countries.
